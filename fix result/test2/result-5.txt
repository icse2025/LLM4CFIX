### ChangeLog:1@D.java
FixDescription: Synchronize access to the shared mutable state variable `x` to prevent race conditions and ensure thread-safe updates when `m1` and `m2` are called concurrently by different threads.
OriginalCode@3-9:
```java
[3]     int x = 0;
[4]     void m1() {
[5]         x++;
[6]     }
[7]     void m2() {
[8]         x *= 2;
[9]     }
```
FixedCode@3-9:
```java
[3]     int x = 0;
[4]     synchronized void m1() {
[5]         x++;
[6]     }
[7]     synchronized void m2() {
[8]         x *= 2;
[9]     }
```
