ChangeLog:1@EvenGenerator.java
FixDescription: Ensured thread safety in `EvenGenerator` by synchronizing the `next()` method to prevent race conditions.

OriginalCode@5-8:
```java
[5] 	public int next(){
[6] 		++currentValue;
[7] 		++currentValue;
[8] 		return currentValue;
```
FixedCode@5-8:
```java
[5] 	public synchronized int next(){
[6] 		++currentValue;
[7] 		++currentValue;
[8] 		return currentValue;
```

### Explanation:
The `next()` method in `EvenGenerator` increments the `currentValue` twice to produce an even number. However, without synchronization, multiple threads could interleave these operations, leading to inconsistent states where `currentValue` might not be even. By adding the `synchronized` keyword to the `next()` method, we ensure that only one thread can execute this method at a time, maintaining the integrity of `currentValue`.

### Summary:
- Added `synchronized` to the `next()` method in `EvenGenerator` to ensure atomicity and prevent race conditions.
