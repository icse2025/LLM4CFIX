### ChangeLog:1@EvenGenerator.java
FixDescription: Ensured thread safety in `EvenGenerator` by synchronizing the `next()` method to prevent race conditions.

OriginalCode@5-8:
```java
[5] 	public int next(){
[6] 		++currentValue;
[7] 		++currentValue;
[8] 		return currentValue;
```
FixedCode@5-8:
```java
[5] 	public synchronized int next(){
[6] 		++currentValue;
[7] 		++currentValue;
[8] 		return currentValue;
```

### ChangeLog:2@EvenChecker.java
FixDescription: Fixed potential race condition by ensuring `generator` is properly initialized before use.

OriginalCode@3-3:
```java
[3] 	private EvenGenerator generator;
```
FixedCode@3-3:
```java
[3] 	private final EvenGenerator generator;
```

### Summary:
- Added `synchronized` to the `next()` method in `EvenGenerator` to ensure atomicity and prevent race conditions.
- Made the `generator` in `EvenChecker` final to ensure it is properly initialized before being used by multiple threads.
