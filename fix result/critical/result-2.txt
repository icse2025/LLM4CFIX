ChangeLog:1@Section.java
FixDescription: Fix the busy-waiting loop in thread 1 to correctly wait for its turn and use volatile keyword for the 'turn' variable to ensure visibility across threads.
OriginalCode@3-4:
[3]     Critical t;
[4]     int threadNumber;
FixedCode@3-4:
[3]     volatile Critical t;
[4]     int threadNumber;

OriginalCode@20-24:
[20]                 t.turn = 1;
[21]                 System.out.println("In critical section, thread number = " + threadNumber);
[22]                 while(t.turn != 1);
[23]                 System.out.println("Out critical section, thread number = " + threadNumber);
[24]                 t.turn = 0;
FixedCode@20-24:
[20]                 t.turn = 1;
[21]                 System.out.println("In critical section, thread number = " + threadNumber);
[22]                 while(t.turn != 0);  // Correct the condition to wait until it's not thread 0's turn
[23]                 System.out.println("Out critical section, thread number = " + threadNumber);
[24]                 t.turn = 0;
