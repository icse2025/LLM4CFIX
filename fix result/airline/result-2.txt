ChangeLog:1@Bug.java
FixDescription: Fix the atomicity violation and data race issues by synchronizing access to the shared variables `Num_Of_Seats_Sold` and `StopSales` to ensure that these operations are performed atomically and safely across multiple threads.
OriginalCode@11-15:
[11]         Num_Of_Seats_Sold++;                       
[12]         if (Num_Of_Seats_Sold > Maximum_Capacity)  
[13]             StopSales = true;                      
[14]     }
FixedCode@11-15:
[11]         synchronized (this) {
[12]             Num_Of_Seats_Sold++;                       
[13]             if (Num_Of_Seats_Sold > Maximum_Capacity)  
[14]                 StopSales = true;                      
[15]         }
