### ChangeLog:1@SetCheck2.java
FixDescription: Ensure atomic update of related fields `a` and `b` within a single synchronized block to prevent race conditions where these variables are set in separate synchronized blocks. This ensures consistency between `a` and `b` across all threads.
OriginalCode@6-13:
```java
[6]     synchronized (this) {
[7]     	a = i;
[8]     	System.out.println("a set to " + i);
[9]     }
[10] 	synchronized (this) {
[11] 		b = -i;
[12] 		System.out.println("b set to " + -i);
[13] 	}
```
FixedCode@6-13:
```java
[6]     synchronized (this) {
[7]         a = i;
[8]         b = -i;
[9]         System.out.println("a set to " + i);
[10]        System.out.println("b set to " + -i);
[11]    }
```
