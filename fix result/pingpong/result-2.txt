ChangeLog:1@BuggedProgram.java
FixDescription: Fix the race condition in the pingPong method by synchronizing access to the shared pingPongPlayer object to prevent multiple threads from modifying it concurrently.
OriginalCode@40-48:
[40]     public void pingPong() {
[41]     	this.pingPongPlayer.getI();
[42]         PP newPlayer;
[43]         newPlayer = this.pingPongPlayer;
[44]         this.pingPongPlayer = null;
[45]         long time = System.currentTimeMillis();
[46]         while ((System.currentTimeMillis() - time) < 50) ;
[47]         this.pingPongPlayer = newPlayer;
[48]     }
FixedCode@40-48:
[40]     public synchronized void pingPong() {
[41]         if (this.pingPongPlayer != null) {
[42]             this.pingPongPlayer.getI();
[43]         }
[44]         PP newPlayer = this.pingPongPlayer;
[45]         this.pingPongPlayer = null;
[46]         long time = System.currentTimeMillis();
[47]         while ((System.currentTimeMillis() - time) < 50) ;
[48]         this.pingPongPlayer = newPlayer;
[49]     }
